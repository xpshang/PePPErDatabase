DATA UPLOAD INSTRUCTIONS FOR PePPEr DATABASE
Last update: 01 November 2023 by Samuel Mitchell
How to correctly submit data for review by admin
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
>>
>>
Download the database template on the PePPEr website
>>
Fill in the following data columns using these given formats:
Afterwards, upload file and submit for review by admin
The data will be checked to ensure consistency with other database entries
Once this has been completed, you will receive confirmation of data uploaded to PePPEr
>>
A. Publication: 
[Last_name et al. YYYY] or [Last_name and last_name. YYYY]
Data from PhD publications should be: [Last_name PhD thesis. YYYY]
Data from Masters publications should be: [Last_name MS thesis. YYYY]
Data from Bachelors publications should be: [Last_name BS thesis. YYYY]
>>
B. Volcano: 
Give the most commonly used/known name to collate with possible pre-existing data
>>
C. Eruption:
Give as [YYYY (or XX ka), eruption_unit, style]
Style can be e.g. Strombolian, Plinian fallout, PDC deposit
>>
D. Data DOI:
Given in the format [https://doi.org/.....] e.g. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.01.011
>>
E. Chemistry:
From the TAS classification - Picrobasalt, Basalt, Basaltic Andesite, Andesite, Dacite, Rhyodacite, Rhyolite....
...Trachybasalt, Basaltic trachyandesite, Trachyandesite, Trachydacite, Trachyte, Basanite, Phonotephrite....
...Foidite, Tephriphonolite, Phonolite
If you are unsure of the correct field, plot the data up in the data plotter as (X) SiO2 wt.% vs. (Y) Total Alkali wt.%
>>
F,G,H,I. Chemistry values (wt %):
For both bulk and glass analyses, give the SiO2 and Na2O+K2O wt.% as XX.XX wt.% of 100
>>
J. Chemistry data DOI:
Given in the format [https://doi.org/.....] e.g. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2017.01.011
>>
K. Rock/experiment type:
Give the simplest description of deposit type e.g. Scoria, Pumice, Lava flow, Lava dome, Block and ash flow, Breadcrust bomb, Tuffisite
Or the simplest description of experiment type and [material used] e.g. vesiculation, decompression, densification, sintering, [glass beads, ash]
>>
L. Subaerial/submarine:
Are the deposits subaerial or submarine (or emergent)? Leave empty for experimental data
>>
M. Effusive/explosive:
Are the natural deposits effusive or explosive? Clastic or coherent can be used if ensure of "style" e.g. submarine pumice
For experimental data, use vesiculation, densification or sintering
>>
N. Sample no.:
Quote the sample number as given directly within the publication text or supplement data files
>>
O. Bulk porosity (%):
Enter values for bulk(total) porosity of a sample as a volume % of 100
>>
P. Connected porosity (%):
Enter values for just the exterior connected porosity of a sample as a volume % of 100. Measured usually be pycnometry techniques
>>
Q. Connectivity:
Enter value for connected porosity / bulk(total) porosity. Dimensionless. Should be value of 0.000 - ~1.000
>>
R,S. Permeabilites:
Enter values for Darcian(viscous) and inertial permeabilities in R(k1) and S(k2) respectively. Values given in m^-2 and m^-1 respectively
>>
T. Vesicle number density (m-3):
Enter determined value for 3D VND in m^-3 (no logarithmic values)
>>
U. S (polydispersivity):
Value of S can be calculated in the polydispersivity tool in PePPEr. Data required are particle size bins and corresponding volume(mass) fractions
>>
V,W,X Crystallinities (%):
Give values for total-,pheno-, and micro-crystallinities as % of total volume (no vesicularity corrections in this database).
Columns W and X should add up to data in column V.
>>
>>
Not all columns require filling in... we would be very impressed if you have collected everything in this list!
